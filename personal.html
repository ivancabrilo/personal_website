    <p>Hi! My name is Iván. I'm 20 years old. Here are some fun facts about myself:</p>
    
    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I was born on 7th of August 2003, and I left my home country 🇲🇪 on 7th of September 2019 to study abroad in Germany 🇩🇪. After one amazing year in a foreign country, 
    I decided to continue my journey at UWCiM (IB diploma) in Bosnia & Herzegovina 🇧🇦. These 2 years spent in the city of Mostar are unforgettable and perhaps the best period of my life.
    Here I made life-long lasting friendships with people from all around the world (very international community +60 nationalites). Towards the end of my final year of IB, I recieved a full
    ride offer from University of Rochester which brought me to USA 🇺🇸. </p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>What makes me an interesting person are my excellent social interaction skills. Combined with my fluency in 4 languages 🇷🇸,🇬🇧,🇩🇪,🇪🇸, I am very extroverted. I love traveling and have been to many places around the world.</p>
    <p> Wherever I go, I make friends, and trust me I go everywhere. I just love travelling and this past summer I had 4 amazing months around the globe.</p>
    <p> I am a Half-Marthon runner, and really a sports freak, I love both watching and playing different sports ⚽🎾🥏🏀🏐.</p>
    <p> Music makes my day, and I listen to all geners of music 70% of my day. Favorite music geners: Techno, House, Rock, Punk.</p>
